# Me
- Name: Alaa Al Shaba

# About My Website

- I based the theme of my website around the 2 minute video that I shot in my Comm Lab class, which was mainly cats and bright, soft colors to compliment.

# Project Name

- I called my website **'Just Kittin'** as a pun towrds the general theme of my website; cats.

# Project Description

- My website contains 6 main components
    - The main video about a certain campus cat, in which the theme of my website is centered around.
    - A slideshow on the right that allows the user to flip through different sites they can click on and adopt a cat.
    - A slideshow on the left that allows the user to flip through different images they can click on and donate to different pet organizations.
    - A description on the bottom of the video explaining the story behind it.
    - A circle on the left side that the user can click on to go to the behind the scenes page.
    - 3 circular videos on the right side containing cute cat videos to enjoy.

- The video
    - The main video is about a campus cat that, due to being very hungry and curious, becomes a human and tries out human food. It is meant to tell a story about how animals might percieve human activities and areas.


# Process

- My process in making this website consisted of an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. Through the HTML, I was able to display my texts, boxes, and videos on the screen. With the help of my CSS and JavaScript files, I was able to make my site more interactive by adding slideshows, circulr frames for videos, as well as correct positioning and color.


# Reflection/Evaluation

- Overall, I learned a lot from making this website. Through many, many errors, I was able to learn better ways of positioning portions of my website on the screen in a much more efficient way. I was able to learn how interactivity worked through JavaScript, and how I can connect my many files to form one functional site.

- I had many challenges, and one of the main ones was being able to position the different elements of my site without effecting the other elements around it. Additionally, I struggled with displaying the **Adopt** slideshow as it wasn't appearing. After many hours of debugging, I was able to figure out that the error was coming from my JS file, and I simply had ot adjust one of the functions. One more challenge I faced (and still currently am) is that some of the elements of my site (such as the **Adopt** slideshow) kept changing positions when I uploaded it to my GitHub. It seemed fine in my local browser, but on GitHub it changed a slight amount. I am still looking to solve this issue.

- Overall, my expectations and goals were met in this site, as most of the things I detailed on my mockup I was able to implement. One thing I decided to scrap due to time was the "Add a Review" portion, where users can leave comments or reviews on the video. However, I hope to dd it sometime in the future.
