# My Website

Welcome to my website where I host the the video I shot about a certain campus cat...

## General look

My website consists of 5 main parts
- The video where you can view what we shot and enjoy the story
- A quick video description
- A slideshow on the right where you can click through different images to donate to cat/pet organizations (images are clickable)
- A slideshow on the left where you can click through differentt images to adopt a cat (images are clickable)
- Three circular videos where you can view cute kittens doing their thing
- A large circle you can click on to go to the BTS footage page, where you can see the behinid the scene footage and credits



## Theme

- The main theme was cats, so the color scheme is colorful, specifically pink and teal. The teal helps the website pop and compliments the pink.
